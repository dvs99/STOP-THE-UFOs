# Stop the UFOs
Game developed using Unity game engine, designed in collaboration with another game development student but programmed entirely by me. It is a tower defense game, where the player has to defend their territory from the enemies by placing defensive structures along the enemiesâ€™ path of attack. There are two functional types of towers right now, each with a different type of attack or effect. There are also different types of enemies which have different characteristics. The game also includes power ups with a limited number of uses, turret upgrades and turret targeting method selection. Finally there is a multi lane mode where the enemies can follow two different paths. You can download the current version in the releases page of this repository, note that you need to manually start each wave with the button on the bottom left corner so that you can have time to place turrets between waves. All assets in the game are free assets from Kenney modified by me as I see fit. 

## Team setup
Programmer: Diego Villabrille Seca\
Game designers: Darius Ionut Abrudan and Diego Villabrille Seca

## Portfolio relevance
This project shows that I am capable of gameplay programming with C# in Unity by myself with good results. I also think it is important because it showcases my ability to develop a game following the requirements from a Game Design Document written in colaboration with a different student and sticking to the required product.
